# Entry PostDate Checker

This plugin checks entries after save. When an entry is scheduled and overlapping another entry's date and time (within a scope of X minutes or hours), the user gets notified about it. The goal is to prevent users publishing entries on the same date and time.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 5.5.0 or later, and PHP 8.2 or later.
